# CCTV-GoAhead-Exploit
## Multi-threaded CCTV Camera scanner using the GoAhead webserver exploit

First:
```
python3 cctvscan.py <File Name>
(e.g. python3 cctvscan.py scanned.txt)
```
This uses the Shodan IOT search engine to find CCTV cameras with the GoAhead vulnerability.

Second:
```
python3 cctvbrute.py <input file> <output file>
(e.g. python3 cctvbrute.py scanned.txt vuln.txt)
```

Once you have bruted the list, you can browse to the webserver by typing the IP:PORT into your browser.
Then you can login with the credentials.
